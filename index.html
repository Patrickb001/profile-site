        "Don't think about why you question, simply don't stop questioning.
        Don't worry about what you can't answer, and don't try to explain what
        you can't know. Curiosity is its own reason. Aren't you in awe when you
        contemplate the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous
        structure behind reality? ... Try to comprehend a little more each day.
        Have holy curiosity.
