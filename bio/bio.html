              Hi! My name is Patrick and I'm a front-end engineer based in
              Houston, TX. I recently graduated from nursing school in May of
              2021. Instead of staying in medicine and pursuing nursing, I
              decided to spend the next few months learning how to create
              websites and web applications in order to become a front-end
              engineer. Over the past year I have studied Javascript, HTML, CSS,
              React and Node through various resources including Udemy and
              Generation USA. I have received certificates for
              HTML/CSS/Javascript courses, and now I am focusing on learning
              React in my free time. I'm also a Software Engineer Apprentice
              employed by Intermountain Healthcare, and I was able to attain
              this apprenticeship through Multiverse.

          <h2>I love to play, study and watch basketball.</h2>
          <p>
            Ever since I can remember basketball has been a part of my life in
            some way. Whether it was playing in my neighborhood with all my
            friends as a child. We would stay outside and play until the street
            lights came on and our parents called us inside. Coming outside the
            next day to finish those games we started to see who would come out
            on top. <br /><br />My love for basketball led to me playing in
            middle school and high school where I got to develop my skills even
            further and challenge myself to play at a higher level. I even got
            to witness my school when the state championship that year, I was
            pretty luck to watch games at that level and cheer on my school.
            <br /><br />Now as an adult I watch mostly NBA games and cheer for
            the Houston Rockets sometimes in person but mostly on TV. I also
            watch a ton of content on YouTube and I like to watch film breaking
            down NBA games.

          <h2>Reading is one of my favorite things to do!</h2>
          <p>
            Reading is one of my early and favorite memories from school. My
            love for reading originally came from books like Magic Tree House,
            Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the Percy Jackson series and so much more. I
            recognized early that reading was like a movie playing in my mind
            that I could take anywhere with me. <br />
            <br />I always loved the imagery from these creative books and the
            hobby found me again in adulthood. Now some of my favorite books to
            date have been Deep Work by Cal Newport, Mastery by Robert Greene
            and Animal Farm by George Orwell.
